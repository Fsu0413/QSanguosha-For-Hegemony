Introduction (By Moligaloo)
----------

Sanguosha is both a popular board game and online game,
this project try to clone the Sanguosha online version.
The whole project is written in C++,
using Qt's graphics view framework as the game engine.
I've tried many other open source game engines,
such as SDL, HGE, Clanlib and others,
but many of them lack some important features.
Although Qt is an application framework instead of a game engine,
its graphics view framework is suitable for my game developing.
